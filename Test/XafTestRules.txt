General Rules

1) make sure you are only testing the code that you created (beware of start confusing testing your code with testing the framework,BTW the framework is already tested)
2) Create your code in a way that facilitates unit testing
3) Create the test scenarios based on how you apply any Xaf functionality to your business problem as the following examples
   -Check the an editor to see if a visual rule is applied 
   -Check the state of an action on certain detail view or list view
   -Execute actions that handle data and then check if the data is on the correct state



Possible testing scenarios

A) Create a view with one of the following methods
-SetupListViewForController
-SetupDetailViewControllerForNewObject
